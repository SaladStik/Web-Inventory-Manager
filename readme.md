# THIS IS VERY EARLY DEVELOPMENT AND NOT FULLY FUNCTIONAL

This is basically just a viewer for the data generated by the c# app until i implement all of the real functionality

# Project Documentation

## Overview

This project is designed to take in and store data about all of your products. It aims to simplify inventory management with a small learning curve for smaller teams who may or may not want to buy a large software package.

The backend has been migrated to **Go** and serves live inventory updates using Server-Sent Events. To start the server run:

```bash
go run main.go
```

## Database

The backend now uses PostgreSQL for persistence. Configure the connection using the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable. The server will create required tables and a default `admin` user on startup.

```bash
export DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/webinventory?sslmode=disable
go run main.go
```

## Screenshots

Here is a little overview of what the product overview page looks like in comparison to its much older and uglier(although 1000x more functional as of the current state) sibling
